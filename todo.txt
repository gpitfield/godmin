Deal with organizing list fields -> make Marshal map[string]AdminField?

newModelAdmin should just take lists of field names and convert those to maps


wwwform
	Marshal an object to a []AdminField
	Unmarshal url.values to map[string]interface{}
		interface{} is either string, [], or map[string]interface{} (nested)

structmap
	Unmarshal map[string]interface{} to interface{} (struct)





admin struct tags:
	idonly // only show related object id (for embedded/linked objects)
	- // exclude
	fieldname



Take url.values and unmarshal into an interface (just like package json)
Take struct and marshal into 
	map[string]interface{} ?
	map[string] someType

type AdminField struct {
	Name string // object attribute name
	identifier string // parentIdentifier + self Identifier
	value string
	type string
	children []AdminField -> this can be either fields, or field type "struct" for lists
	(do this last)
}

slice, struct html includes a "delete" checkbox which removes them




Call init functions on insert (?) -> define an interface for hooks and call that if available
Read only change form for embedded objects (for now, do this as json dump)
Writeable change form for linked Objects
