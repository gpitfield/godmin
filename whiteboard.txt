how to pass arguments to functions (e.g. delete a list of IDs)
use the right widgets (e.g. for bool field)

admin needs to:
	provide table view and detail/form view for different objects
	enable setting those up based on fields to expose
	allow for actions to be taken on a list of items
	allow for actions to be taken on a specific item

	package needs to implement admin interface - list, instance, functions
	package registers itself with the admin on init via admin.Register
	admin then generates endpoints

Serializer interface gets implemented for different database backends.
For mongo, we'll have a function that wraps a *mgo.Collection returning func to provide the interface
